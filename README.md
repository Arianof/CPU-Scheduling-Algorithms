## CPU Scheduling Algorithms Implemented in C

1. FCFS: This algorithm operates on a First-In-First-Out basis.
    
2. SJF: This algorithm sorts all processes based on their burst time before processing them. It is a greedy algorithm that minimizes waiting time compared to other scheduling algorithms.
    
3. Priority: This algorithm arranges all processes based on their priority before processing them. However, this algorithm may lead to starvation. One possible solution is Aging.
    
4. Round Robin: This algorithm allocates a quantum time to process all processes fairly.
